# FortiFin


## To start FortiFin for the first time
1. Run the Setup script
2. Run the Login script

‼️In case installation failes at mysql connection, try reinstalling mysql to latest version. Though the true nature of this failure is not yet deduced, this solves the error generally.

## For future use 
1. Directly run the Login script

‼️ Beware the the Setup script ![DROPS]! any previous databases under the name banking_project to create a new database with 5 empty tables in its name.

 ⚡FortiFin is meant to be used as an educational tool and not a full fledged commercial application. As of this moment the application's development is on hold and no further updates will be added by the original writers of this. 

The only expected addition is the documentary's final asset file.

The application is used without internet, though at the time of installation we require an internet connectionfor installing required libraries

The Libraries required for this are:
            1. mysql-connector-python
            2. pillow
            3. pandas
            4. pyperclip
